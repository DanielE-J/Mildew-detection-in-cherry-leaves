## Introduction

Mildew detection in cherry leaves is a data science and machine learning (ML) project that uses predictive analytics to tell the difference between 2 different sets of images. The business goal is to assist the client, an agri-food business who is dealing with an infestation of powdery mildew in its cherry tree plantations. 

Currently the client is inspecting trees manually to determine whether they are infected or not and then treated if found to be diseased. This process is both labour intensive and time consuming. We propose the creation of a ML model that can determine from photographs of leaves whether mildew is present, reducing the amount of time taken to determine the status of the tree and enable sick trees to be treated with greater efficiency and accuracy. 

The project is hosted on the streamlit app and a live version may be found [here](https://cherrypowderymildewdetector-eb00906f7030.herokuapp.com/)


## Dataset Content

- The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/codeinstitute/cherry-leaves). 
- - The dataset contains over 4 thousand images taken from the client's cherry tree plantations. The images are divided into 2 sets, one of healthy leaves and one of leaves that are infected with powdery mildew. a fungal disease that affects many plant species. The client is concerned that the outbreak may be compromising the quality of their crop, which in turn would have serious ramifications for their business at large.

## Business Requirements

This project's main objective is to create a machine learning model that can detect whether a given tree has powdery mildew or not based on photographs uploaded to the dashboard as opposed to manual inspections of each tree, reducing costs in time and labour. This will result in more effective treatment and prevent a decline in crop quality. 

Key stakeholders for this are Farmy & Foods themselves, and their customers.

When considering the business requirements and how to meet them, attention must be paid to the following:

* The ML model produced must be accurate in its predictions of whether a leaf is infected or not
* The model should be able to handle multiple items concurrently
* The results produced from uploads must be easy to understand for both technical and non-technical personnel.
* The model must be able to return a prediction quickly

The specific requirements are as follows:

1. The client is interested in conducting a study to visually differentiate a healthy cherry leaf from one with powdery mildew. This should provide average images of both kinds of leaves, as well as a variability image for each.
2. The client is interested in predicting if a cherry leaf is healthy or contains powdery mildew. To meet this requirement, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) should be developed to classify images as healthy or infected.

## Hypotheses

### Hypothesis 1

> Infected leaves exhibit visible discoloration, spots, or deformities that are not present on healthy leaves.

### Hypothesis 1 Validation

**1. Introduction**

Cherry leaves affected by powdery mildew often show distinct visual symptoms. The earliest sign is usually a light-green, circular lesion on either side of the leaf, followed by the appearance of a fine, white, cotton-like growth in the infected area. To enable a machine learning model to recognize these characteristics effectively, the images must be preprocessed appropriately before being used for feature extraction and training.

  1. Understand problem and mathematical functions

When we are dealing with an Image dataset, it's important to normalize the images in the dataset before training a Neural Network on it. This is required because of the following two core reasons:
- It helps the trained Neural Network give consistent results for new test images.
- Helps in Transfer Learning
To normalize an image, one will need the mean and standard deviation of the entire dataset.

To calculate the **mean** and **standard deviation**, the mathematical formula takes into consideration four dimensions of an image (B, C, H, W) where:
- B is batch size that is number of images
- C is the number of channels in the image which will be 3 for RGB images.
- H is the height of each image
- W is the width of each image
Mean and std is calculated separately for each channel. The challenge is that we cannot load the entire dataset into memory to calculate these paramters. We can load a small set of images (batches) one by one and this can make the computation of mean and std non-trivial.

**2. Observation**
### Hypothesis 2

> The softmax activation function yields superior performance compared to the sigmoid activation function when used in the output layer of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

### Hypothesis 2 Validation

### Hypothesis 3

> Model accuracy is influenced by the output layerâ€™s activation function. Our initial study used a sigmoid for binary classification of healthy vs. diseased leaves. We now propose using softmax for multi-class classification, which we expect to reduce accuracy.

### Hypothesis 3 Validation
